The [“call for talents”](https://medium.com/team-per-la-trasformazione-digitale/from-seattle-to-roma-innovation-citizens-talents-6b8c6c06002b), launched by The Digital Transformation Team on September 30, 2016 allowed to create the current team, which has worked on building the ["operating system of the country"](https://medium.com/team-per-la-trasformazione-digitale/new-operating-system-country-technological-competence-plans-11b50a750ea7). A series of fundamental blocks described inside the [Three Year Plan for the Digital Transformation of the Italian Public Administration](https://medium.com/team-per-la-trasformazione-digitale/three-year-digital-transformation-plan-italian-public-administration-guidelines-design-development-8bdb440f940d), upon which simpler and more effective services for citizens, the Public Administration, and enterprises are built.

The team already started several projects, such as [PagoPA](https://medium.com/team-per-la-trasformazione-digitale/pagopa-pay-one-click-italian-digital-government-services-public-administration-53bcf1a6d52d), a unique node for Italian public payments, where people can pay taxes, university tuition fees and school meals, fines and TARI (solid waste tax), and ANPR - the National Residential Population Register - a single national database designed to combine the demographic data of all Italian residents and Italian residents abroad. In addition to that the Team launched [Developers Italia](https://medium.com/team-per-la-trasformazione-digitale/developers-italia-community-italian-digital-government-services-public-administration-2e56022096f1) and [Designers Italia](https://medium.com/team-per-la-trasformazione-digitale/designers-italia-community-italian-digital-government-services-public-administration-design-thinking-c1a1de23c465), the community platforms that provide technical documentation, development and design kits, testing environments, guidelines and a forum, in order to promote the development of digital public services.

The reinforcement of these projects, among which the implementation of the [Three Year Plan](https://pianotriennale-ict.italia.it/),  requires now further efforts! For this reason the Team  is looking for new bilingual (Italian and English) talents with proven experience in computer science (software architecture, mobile application development, open source software, APIs), mathematics and statistics (predictive models, machine learning), product design, user experience. 
Do you share our [Manifesto](https://medium.com/team-per-la-trasformazione-digitale/from-seattle-to-roma-innovation-citizens-talents-6b8c6c06002b) of technological and operating principles? Then send us your resume!
All the open positions* reported below are in english and in italian.

Good luck!
