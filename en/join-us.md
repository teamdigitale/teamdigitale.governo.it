# Join us

[Diego Piacentini's first call](https://medium.com/team-per-la-trasformazione-digitale/from-seattle-to-roma-innovation-citizens-talents-6b8c6c06002b) on September 30 allowed us to create the current [team](https://teamdigitale.governo.it/en/49-content.htm), which has been working on the Italian Digital Agenda projects since the beginning of 2017: now we're looking for talents who can help us start building the country's ["operating system."](https://medium.com/team-per-la-trasformazione-digitale/new-operating-system-country-technological-competence-plans-11b50a750ea7)

## Keep in Mind

Keep in mind: we are working in a government environment. 

People will tell us “you don’t comprehend how the public administration works”, “many already tried and failed” and “in Italy it doesn’t work this way!”

We will get a lot of criticism.  Some will be sincere and helpful, some will be prejudiced and cynical. The former will come from people who genuinely want to help, the latter from people who either need to defend the status quo or believe the glass is always “half empty” or, more simply, have learned helplessness.  

For those who are not afraid of such obstacles, who feel a deep connection with these objectives and with these principles, thrive in ambiguous situations, have a knack for simplification, our team is the right place.
