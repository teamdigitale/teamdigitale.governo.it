I graduated in Physics at the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa and continued my studies by starting a PhD in Applied Physics at the California Institute of Technology (Pasadena - USA). My main interests have included the development of quantum computers through topological methods.

At that time, since I was missing my country and was far away from my loved one led me to take a sabbatical and return to Italy. The most important aspects that struck me during my American experience were the importance and value of failure, and the fact that the whole world is surprisingly passionate about Italy and Italians.

From May 2014 to April 2016 I worked with the Technical Secretariat of the Ministry of Economic Development, in particular on innovation-related policies and actions aimed to attract investments in highly innovative sectors.

On February 10th I read the news that Diego Piacentini was going to return to Italy to work for two years for the Italian Government on the country’s Digital Agenda and innovation, and immediately wrote him an email. My goal was to work with him under any condition.

I'm part of the Global Shapers Community of the World Economic Forum, a non-profit association for the promotion of projects featuring a strong social impact.

I love music: I earned a diploma in Piano at the Niccolò Paganini Conservatory in Genova.
