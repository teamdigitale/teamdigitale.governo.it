My professional history was driven by my passion for journalism and aptitude for digital contents. While I was studying communication and journalism at the University (in Perugia and Rome), I was working within a small group of friends to the creation of a start up - a social network for visual arts - awarded by the Ericsson’s program EGO for innovation, and supported by the business accelerator program Topix. 

I have followed this “double path” also at a later time: during my two years internship at the Associated Press and Reuters, in Rome, where I worked with TheBlogTV (today User Farm): a startup specialized in user-generated video contents. That was an experience that allowed me to get a deep knowledge of digital contents, studying the first period of viral contents while getting skilled in the management of communities and platforms based on Crowdsourcing. 

In 2012 my journalism activity became more structural, with the publication of the first enquiries. In that year, I won the first Roberto Morrione television award. In the meanwhile, after winning the Mario Formenton award, I had the opportunity to work with Gruppo Editoriale l’Espresso (today Gedi). In that period I began to work as a freelance video journalist for online media outlets, such as Corriere.it, Repubblica.it, TheTelegraph.co.uk, and as a digital content specialist for the Gedi digital division (Radio Deejay, M2O, TvZap, IlMioLibro, Iniziative Editoriali, etc.). 

I joined the Digital Team in 2017 as freelance content manager for the project Designers Italia. From the beginning of 2019, I have been working with the communication team. It is a challenge that I face with enthusiasm and civic duty, since I consider important to tell the good work that this team is doing: a “sustainable digital development”, that could be a key point for our Country, in order to offer more efficient services and let citizens have an easier life. But also to be ready to face the challenges of our time. 

When not in Rome, I live in Spoleto, in the green Umbria, together with my wife Francesca, our two years old daughter Annalou and his best friend, the dog Balou. Here we manage a small but lively coworking and we try to enjoy as much as we can our friends, families and the beauty of the mountains and nature all around us.
