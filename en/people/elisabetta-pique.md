My first interaction with a computer happened when I was 10: it was very big, heavy, with black and white images; my dad used to code on it in MS-DOS. Unlike my colleagues of the Italian Digital Team, I didn’t become a developer or a computer scientist but, inside me, the interest for technologies remained vivid. I am fascinated by the potential of streamlining and improving many aspects of everyday life and by all the possibilities that could arise from these processes. I believe my passion for data analytics and optimization was born this way.

Interest in modern arts and numbers brought me first to graduate in Economics and Management for Arts, Culture and Communication - and then to get a Master of Science in Accounting, Financial Management and Control , both at Bocconi University in Milan. Art and numbers, two interests perhaps far away from each other, together with love for new experiences, drove me to travel to find a profession that could combine them. From South Africa, to Mexico, going through Singapore and Malaysia, I’ve worked in e-commerce startups focusing on onsite, content analytics and online marketing campaigns that conjugate perfectly my passion for data analytics and product design.

Once back in Italy, [Diego’s call for talents](https://medium.com/team-per-la-trasformazione-digitale/from-seattle-to-roma-innovation-citizens-talents-6b8c6c06002b) infused so much passion and enthusiasm in me that, after meeting him at an event, I literally tailed him until I got to introduce myself and convince him to consider my application. After a few interviews my adventure with the Italian Digital Team began in December 2016.

I’m a dogged and resolute person, I love scuba diving and photography, travelling and interacting with different cultures.
