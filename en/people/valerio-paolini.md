I’m 46, I live in Bologna, I’m married and the father of a digital native.  My passion for IT started when I was very young. Immediately after the inevitable Commodore 64 season everything became very serious when, at 15, I had to choose between an Apple Computer and a scooter: I didn’t have a single doubt and I took the Apple. It wasn’t cheap, but I believe it was one of my best choices ever.

I spent a large part of my professional life looking for and organizing connections in the music environment, building platforms that entertained and informed a very large audience. First in Dada, then in Musixmatch (I was one of the founders), I lead my team in building scalable systems for managing information, taking care of everything from designing to maintenance. In particular I have been in charge for the design and development of a Digital Asset Management platform to handle recording labels catalogues, and then for music publishing, where I managed world wide copyright information.

Another important experience was with SMS.it, a mobile internet pioneer company, where I designed and developed a web delivery SMS system, still being used.

I am member of Epeerrahtee Ltd board of advisors, an English startup dedicated to provide international phone calls at local prices, where I offer my expertise in open source technologies and system architectures for the mobile world.

I had the opportunity to work with people coming from all over the world, to appreciate cultural and professional differences.

At the time of my studies, interrupted with a few regrets because I had to get to work as soon as possible, I had the opportunity to watch the birth of Internet as we now know it. I did my part by creating a group of students that became one of the first generations of DevOps. The college years, when I was attending Computer Science at University of Bologna, were a wonderful training place, very rich with opportunities to meet and to discuss with friends and colleagues. Those years strengthened my deep curiosity toward the treatment of information, giving me the instruments to understand its dynamics and peculiarities.

I was intrigued by Diego Piacentini’s introduction to the project and I was moved by the unique opportunity to give back a service to my country. I have made myself available to this modern, ambitious and exciting challenge.

I love Star Wars and James Bond movies: my favorite character is Q, the wizard in charge of technologies, played historically by Desmond Llewellyn. I love jazz and easy listening music. I am not a soccer fan, but every time my friends managed to bring me to a game, their team always wins.
