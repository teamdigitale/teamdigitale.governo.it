I decided to study law after spending my childhood between courts and public prosecutors' offices, playing around with mock files. I graduated in Law from the University of Florence and from the Sorbonne in Paris, specializing in Intellectual Property Law.  While  working in this field, I started dealing with Internet related legal matters, thus, I decided to do a Master's degree in Information Technology law at Queen Mary University in London. 

Since 2011, I have been working as a lawyer on internet law and regulation at Hogan Lovells law firm where I had the opportunity of assisting the largest players of the online market. Running, pilates and yoga are my weapons of defence against the fast speed of the digital economy.

Privacy and data protection law began to take over my days, with a peak in May 2018 with the entry into force of the new European regulation (GDPR). Since then the GDPR compliance has become my bread and butter!

Increasingly convinced that privacy is not just a series of boring and sterile requirements, I have contributed  to raise and foster awareness of privacy culture in companies and schools as well. During my first lecture on digital education to high school students, I opened the window and asked them to shout out their latest post on Facebook. The students, quite disoriented, replied: “We don’t use Facebook, our parents do”.  “OK “-  I thought - “This is a failed experiment”; actually, my first thought was: “I’m getting old…”. 

Survived to the calamitous May 2018, I assisted  the Digital Team in some privacy matters. Impressed by their mission, enthusiasm and competence, I wished  to be part of this ongoing small revolution.

I met Luca Attias shortly after his appointment, and decided to be part of  this adventure, since  I wished to put my knowledge and experience to the service of the Team and my country. This decision was made possible also with the help of my team at Hogan Lovells, which will have to go on without me for few months. I do thank them for their support.

I’m well aware that the next months will be intense and require many adjustments:  new challenges, people, environment, most likely, all very different from what I was used to. But I am sure they will be months of personal and professional growth, in which I hope to be able to raise the culture of privacy in the institutions of my country at least a little.
