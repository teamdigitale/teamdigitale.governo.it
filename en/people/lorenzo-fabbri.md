It was late September when I read that a working group dedicated to the Digital Transformation within the Italian Government was forming and I thought to myself: “This is exactly what I would like to do”. A few months later, here I am. I will be responsible for Content Design, which involves understanding user needs, organization of content and services, with special attention to simplification.

In 2001 I graduated magna cum laude with a degree in Cultural and Communication Studies under Professor Umberto Eco from the University of Bologna. In 2003 I got a Master’s Degree in Marketing and Communication Management from Cattolica University in Milan. I am now doing an Executive MBA at Luiss Business School in Rome. From 2006 to 2010 I was adjunct professor at the Sapienza University of Rome. I am currently a lecturer at Florence University, for the Master’s in Publishing Program at the Sapienza University of Rome, at the Digital Cultures Laboratory at The University of Pisa and at the International University of Language and Media in Milan. I write for Problemi dell’Informazione (published by Il Mulino) and am a speaker and supporter of the Internet Festival in Pisa.

I have been involved in communication for 15 years. Over the last 10 I have taken part in a number of digital innovation and transformation projects for Gruppo Editoriale l’Espresso. Since 2012 I have been a member of the digital division managing committee. I have worked in a team with engineers, designers, researchers, data analysts, editors and project managers on analyzing digital trends and the innovators’ strategies. We have founded startups, evaluated new technologies, probed customer needs, designed sites and apps and introduced new methodologies. It has been an intense experience. I have given it my all and learned a lot from amazing colleagues under Massimo Russo. Now I got granted to a leave of absence to join Diego Piacentini’s team, after going through a very demanding selection process. I am going to work for the good of the community, applying my talents to the digital transformation of the country with curiosity, concreteness and passion.

Once I really figured out how Google works, it was shocking. And when I figured out that I could spend the weekend binge watching, it was a shock too. I can remember having conversations with my dad about the quality of Wikipedia, then endless talks with a friend about what a digital community is (because Facebook did not even exist back then). Internet shapes our culture. It is the land of the curious. You cannot capture the Internet, if anything, the Internet captures you. At least this is how it was for me.

If I’m not online, it’s because I’m reading *Le favole al telefono*, *La bella addormentata nel fosso (an adaptation)* or some other stories with my kids Caterina and Leonardo. If I’m not in Rome, it’s because I love travelling, especially with Angela.
