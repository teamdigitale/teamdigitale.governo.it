I was a handful of years old when my dad got inside the house with a shiny new
386, unaware of triggering my natural curiosity: in a matter of days
I discovered that, hidden in a nameless floppy, there was the executable of the
legendary “Zool”, a funny jumping gremlin whose digital adventures drove me for
the following months. The real deal was launching that executable: the command
line, presage of obstacles for anyone, shortly became my greatest ally, so much
that even right now when I see a GUI editor I feel lost. 

Some years later, the mysterious dial-up tones became a constant background
melody announcing the possibility of reaching other nodes positioned in the
most remote places on earth. Exciting! To me, the Internet always represented
a bizarre opportunity to study, participate and share, a perfect instrument to
try to fill my irrepressible thirst for knowledge. 

When I was 14 I was stricken by a Richard Stallman conference and, in a matter
of days, I decided that I had to do something: with a couple of friends
I created a group dedicated to the application of the basic concepts of free
software in the education system. Shortly it became very clear how the same
notions we were explaining to our peers could easily be “ported” to teachers,
school managers and, why not, they could also be extended in all the contexts
the citizens live in their everyday normal life. 

Sharing knowledge is the base on top of which it is possible to build real
innovation: it is not conceivable to reinvent the wheel each time we want to
design a new car! In the bit world, this is translated into the practice of
sharing the source code, allowing users to become an active part of the
process, being able to contribute by correcting bugs, enhance some features or
studying the logics in the first place. Like little Dilbert in the comic strip,
I believe I could be classified in “the knack” category which naturally evolves
in picking engineering, with computer and control major in my case. I was
incredibly lucky to work at my master’s thesis under the guidance of Prof. Meo
who offered me the possibility of merging all my greatest passions in a single
project: that’s how FARE came to life, a free software web platform focused on
open education with the aim to create, collect and share with the whole
community a multitude of learning objects in open formats.

Communication networks have been the _leitmotiv_ of my PhD during which
I followed the new adaptive streaming line of research with an eye toward the
free software world and the open education movement. I kept on teaching - which
represents for me a wonderful form of knowledge sharing - in several classes,
starting from robotics for children until reaching university courses.

During the years I participated with different roles in all the editions of the
master in management of free software which gave me the opportunity to study
the logics of the Italian PAs and to understand how to accompany them in the
digital transformation path.

Software aside, I had the incredible luck to roam a lot around the globe living
in five continents and cultivating my great passion for aeronautics: I will
never get bored watching a sunset at 35000 feet. In 2016, thanks to a Fulbright
BEST scholarship, I have been catapulted in the heart of Silicon Valley, an
ecosystem where the keyword is to think differently and failing is lauded
(obviously just if it’s done “fast, early and often”).
In the high tech mecca, I studied at first, then I worked but, mostly, I lived
experiences and I met people who have been key in the development of my current
_forma mentis_.

The Digital Team has been since the beginning so much more than a simple dream:
it represents courage, will, determination and, most of all, concreteness.
As such, more than the _mission_, I have been positively shocked by the people in
the Team who, everyday, demonstrate with extraordinary acuteness that also the
apparently insurmountable problems can be solved in a collaborative fashion,
twisting the point of view from which they have been observed for a long time.
I am extremely motivated to take part of the Teamwork focusing on what I love
the most: sharing ideas, information and software to innovate the PA in order
to make it more lean, efficient and transparent in the complete respect of its
citizens. Said between us, it is also true that I could not wait any longer to
join this team formed by ex-kids who, even if now they are grown up, had never
lost the desire to poke around.
