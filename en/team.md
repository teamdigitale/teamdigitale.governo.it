## About us

The Digital Transformation Team was born to build the "operating system" of the
country, a series of fundamental components on top of which we can build simpler
and more efficient services for the citizens, the Public Administration and
businesses, through innovative digital products.

The Commissioner's Team has been established on September 16, 2016 with an
initial two-year mandate, up to September 16, 2018.

Digital Transformation Team</a> operated under a prorogatio regime until
October 30, 2018.

On October 25, 2018 the new Government Commissioner for the Digital Agenda was
appointed and the Teamâ€™s mandate was extended. The Team will operate until December 31, 2019.
