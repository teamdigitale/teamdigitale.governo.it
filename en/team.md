## About us

The Digital Transformation Team was born to build the "operating system" of the country, a series of fundamental components on top of which we can build simpler
and more efficient services for the citizens, the Public Administration and businesses, through innovative digital products.

The Commissioner's Team was established on September 16, 2016 with an initial two-year mandate, up to September 16, 2018 under the guidance of Diego Piacentini.  
The <a href="http://presidenza.governo.it/AmministrazioneTrasparente/DisposizioniGenerali/AttiGenerali/DpcmOrganismiCollegiali/DPCM_20160916_CommStraord_AgendaDigitale.pdf" title="Prime Minister Decree of Digital agenda commissarial structure" target="_blank">
Digital Transformation Team</a> operated under a prorogatio regime until October 30, 2018.

On October 25, 2018 the new Government Commissioner for the Digital Agenda Luca Attias was appointed and the Team’s mandate was extended until December 31, 2019.

At the end of 2019, the Team’s mandate ended, and from that point the projects will be held by the <a href='https://innovazione.gov.it/' target='_blank'>Department for digital transformation</a> of the Presidency of the Council of ministers and the <a href='https://www.pagopa.gov.it/' target='_blank'>PagoPA Spa</a> company.
