### In short

We have to start writing fewer laws and more software [less codes and more code] and, above all, we must ensure that the laws themselves — which are, by definition, both general and abstract — depict only those principles capable of resisting the passage of time and incapable of burdening us with the innovations and technologies of the past.

Detailed, rule-based regulations are to be translated into bit. Conventions for data exchange between administrations in API [Application Programming Interface] and administrative processes in which discretionary activity is either absent or modest are to be transformed into machine to machine processes, making them more efficient and democratic.
