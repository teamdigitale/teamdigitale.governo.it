### In short
We intend to create guidelines, examples and development kits that can help all administrations in offering digital services that are easy for citizens to use. We want to introduce a development logic and continuous improvement, given that digital products and interfaces must be a living entity that evolves together with the users&#39; needs and digital innovations. The first step was the creation of [Designers Italia] (https://designers.italia.it).

### The role of the Team 
The objective of [Designers Italia] (https://designers.italia.it) is to disseminate a culture of design in digital services that makes the citizen the focal point, in order to save time and money for the public administration and to raise the quality of the services.
The digital transformation team has strengthened the existing project relative to the guidelines of the public websites by creating a platform - Designers Italia - that constitutes a meeting point between the world of design and the public administration. All documentation relating to the design guidelines must be issued in its alpha version and embrace all aspects of human-centred design: service design, user interface design, content design and user research. 
Designers Italia not only produces guides and kits for all public administrations, but directly follows some of the public &quot;infrastructural&quot; digital services such as Pagopa and Spid, whilst activating the creation of models for the different types of public websites, starting from a project dedicated to school websites.
