### In short 

A different and more natural way for citizens to pay the Public Administration, which becomes more immediate, faster, and cheaper for the country. 

Citizens must be able to choose modern payment methods with minimal friction, whilst the market must be able to integrate, easily adding new innovative payment instruments. We want to make the system more open and flexible.

### The data
{% include dashboard.html %}

### The role of the Team 

To allow PagoPA to evolve in a market logic, whilst permitting access to PagoPA for Public Administration services.
Improve the user experience by replicating the processes and methods already in use in the payments market and used daily by citizens.
Allow for the main players within the payment market to be able to offer their own tools to citizens, also for paying for Public Administration services. 

We have thus created, in collaboration with AGID, the new functional specifications of the payment component of PagoPA, creating a simple and secure User Experience and a modern and engaging notification system.
These changes will soon be visible, with the larger municipalities having already become involved.
