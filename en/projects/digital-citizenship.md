### Overview

[Project IO](https://io.italia.it/en/) is a central component of the Italian government’s vision of **digital citizenship**. Its objective is to facilitate the most common transactions between citizens and **central and local** administrations such as:
 
- receiving **communications** and updates;
- obtaining and managing **documents** (notifications, certificates, etc.);
- courtesy deadlines reminder notices;
- making **digital payments**;
- electing a **digital address**.
 
IO embodies  the ultimate example of a user-centric approach to the delivery of digital public service. In fact, one of the project’s objectives is to propose a model in which **citizens are no longer held responsible** for figuring out which services they need nor must go through the laborious task of learning how the digital services work. Instead, the public sector has the responsibility of contacting citizens when needed. It’s also a way of making the public sector’s complexity more ‘transparent’ to citizens.
 
Once the experimental phase will be over, the project will fully implement [Article 64-bis](https://docs.italia.it/italia/piano-triennale-ict/codice-amministrazione-digitale-docs/it/v2017-12-13/_rst/capo5_sezione3_art64-bis.html), Digital Administration Code, which establishes **a single access point for all digital services**.

### The Team's role

The Digital Team has designed and developed the **IO app** and other related services so that **citizens may directly access public services on their smartphones**. The name “IO” encompasses the two main goals of the project:
 
- create a **single interface** for public services;
- provide **personalized services**, tailored to fit each individual need.
 
The app  is based on the **capabilities of several enabling platforms on which the Team is also working**: [SPID](https://teamdigitale.governo.it/en/projects/digital-identity.htm), [pagoPA](https://teamdigitale.governo.it/en/projects/digital-payments.htm), [ANPR](https://teamdigitale.governo.it/en/projects/anpr.htm), the new API-based interoperability model, and the tools and guidelines made available on the [Designers Italia](https://designers.italia.it/) and [Developers Italia](https://developers.italia.it/en) communities.
 
Through their **SPID credentials**, citizens will be able to sign up and then, with a simple **PIN** or **biometric recognition tool** (i.e. fingerprint or face recognition), they will able to  unlock the app for their daily use or needs.
 
Users won’t have to register with each single online service but will have just one contact point that, once they have registered, will interact directly with them on the basis of their tax code, and their individual preferences and needs. Users can disable at any time those services which  no longer interest them, preventing further contact through the app.
 
**Thanks to the integration with pagoPA, citizens can also use IO to make digital payments to the Public Administration** and **save their preferred payment methods** (credit, debit, PayPal, etc.). Paper bills issued within the pagoPA circuit can also be paid using the app, simply by framing a QR code.
 
Project details and information for journalists and public bodies are available on [io.italia.it](https://io.italia.it/en/).  
 
IO is an open source project. All code, documents, discussions and development tools are public and available on the [Developers Italia](https://io.italia.it/en/developers/) forum.

### Benefits for Citizens

The IO app will allow citizens to:
 
- **Receive all notices from the Public Administration** on their smartphone, personalize and manage them in an archive.
- Manage contacts from a central access point that allows citizens to choose, at any time, which services may wish to use.
- Stay **up-to-date on deadlines** and manage alerts in an “integrated” mode (i.e. marking deadlines in a personal calendar and managing payments directly on the app).
- **Make secure payments** to the Public Administration through pagoPA with a variety of payment options to choose from (credit, debit, PayPal, etc.).
- Keep at hand transaction histories and **receipts** at all times.
- Receive and store **documents, receipts, and certificates** directly on their smartphone and share them with a public office in just a few clicks.
- Choose their **digital address** directly on the app (for example, receiving legal documents at a Certified Electronic Mail Box, PEC).
 
The app allows citizens to have **a better understanding of the available digital services**, with **a drastic reduction of bureaucracy**. Moreover, there are many cases in which the use of IO will result into savings for the Public Administration as well, savings that can translate into lower costs for citizens.

### Benefits for Public Administrations

IO will allow Public Administrations to:

- Send electronic notices by **tax code** rather than given address.
- Communicate **deadlines** and receive electronic **payments** more easily.
- Avoid managing and **updating contacts**.
- Send and request **documents** easily and efficiently.
- Manage individual citizen **preferences** centrally.
- Retrieve the **forwarding status** of every communication.
- **Reduce management costs** (notifications, payments, etc.).
- Facilitate payments and **reduce the cost** of recovering credit.
