### In short 

Digital Citizenship aims to render interactions between citizens and the 
Public Administration easier and more familiar, by designing digital services 
around the citizen and his or her information.

Through an open platform of shared components on which to construct 
digital services, we will create an experience that will accompany the citizen 
in interactions with local and national services, as if it were a single great digital home.

The aim is to provide a simpler and more familiar way for the 
Public Administration to communicate with citizens, to provide notification of deeds, reminders concerning deadlines, to share information and documents through
 an interface built around the citizen.

### The role of the Team 

The Digital Team immediately undertook a process of communication concerning 
the vision, coordination and alignment of all the initiatives already underway or in 
the design phase, with the aim of creating a single ecosystem of national and shared components.

Together with AgID, the Digital Transformation Team is developing a number 
of initiatives that are fundamental for the realization of Digital Citizenship:

#### The APIs for communication and preferences management 

The APIs for preferences management will allow the citizen to centrally manage all the information associated with his/her digital citizen 
profile. This information renders it possible to create personalized digital 
services (communication channels, language preference, privacy 
settings, and so on).

The APIs for communication provide a single channel that the Public
Administration can use to send communications, notices, and reminders about
deadlines to the citizen. This communication system is in turn integrated with
the APIs for preferences management to allow the services to communicate with
the citizens based on these preferences.

The APIs are developed as open source, with both the backlog of the activities 
and the code being freely accessible:

*   [backlog of development activities](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2088623)
*   [architectural code](https://github.com/teamdigitale/digital-citizenship)
*   [API code](https://github.com/teamdigitale/digital-citizenship-functions)
*   [documentation for using the APIs](https://teamdigitale.github.io/digital-citizenship/)

To foster a discussion and an exchange of viewpoints, and to encourage the participation 
of all the players involved in the projects, we created a [forum] (https://forum.italia.it/c/piano-triennale/piattaforme-abilitanti).

#### The Digital Citizenship application 

An application designed to meet the needs of the citizen, providing a 
digital place for accessing the experience of Digital Citizenship.

Furthermore, the Digital Citizenship application aims to be a testing ground
to try out integration with the enabling platforms, providing an
 implementation of reference to all of the Public Administrations wanting
to develop digital services.

The application and its components are developed as open source, with both the backlog
 of the activities and the code being freely accessible:

*   backlog of development activities: [mobile app](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2048617)
    and [proxy API](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2116794)
*   code: [mobile app](https://github.com/teamdigitale/italia-app)
    and [proxy API](https://github.com/teamdigitale/italia-backend)

### Benefits

#### For Citizens 

* access the archive of communications with the PA 
* manage contact details from a central access point 
* manage notices in an &quot;integrated&quot; mode (such as when making payments or marking 
deadlines on one&#39;s own calendar)

#### For Administrations 
* send electronic communications using only the tax code (without 
having to ask for the citizens&#39; contact address) 
* not having to deal with the management and updating of contacts 
* give greater authority to communications from the administration  
* communicate deadlines and facilitate the payment of taxes 
* determine the status of sending and reading of the communication
