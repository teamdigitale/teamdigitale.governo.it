    title: Start phase of the project
    desc: The DAF project begins to take shape within the Team with the creation of the group working on the data
  - period: April 2017
    title: Start of development on SPC cloud infrastructure
    desc: Start the creation of the Big Data architecture on SPC cloud (allotment 1). Opening of the repositories as open source software that is downloadable from the link github.com/teamdigitale/daf
  - period: June-December 2017
    title: Data ingestion in the DAF - Experimental phase
    desc: Definition of the databases to be included in the project in the experimental phase and the commissioning of the extraction and ingestion procedures. Defining the relationships between the DAF manager and the PAs involved in the initiative.
  - period: December 2017
    title: Definition and creation of the development plan for the Data &amp; Analytics testing phase
    desc: Identification of the governance model of the DAF and the public administrations that will be part of the testing phase. Defining the platform architecture and its evolutionary roadmap. Definition of use cases for the development of services for Public Administrations, citizens and business.
  - period: December 2018
    title: Production release of the DAF
    desc: The Digital Team and AgID will draw up the procedures for the future owner of the DAF who will manage the operation and the evolution of the project. The owner of the DAF will take care of the interactions with the public administrations to define plans for incorporating their databases and usage cases. From time to time, they will define the data ingestion means and how the DAF is suited to its own activities.

### In short

No more private silos belonging to this or that administration, with public data being a common good and a precious resource for the country that, like an oil field, can be explored and mined to extract value. We are seeking a new interface within which the single administrations can communicate and share data and APIs in a free and open way, allowing for the creation of new and previously-unthinkable services and data applications realised on the basis of the needs of the citizen. Obviously, this is all with the utmost respect for the regulations on privacy and in complete technological security.

#### Advantages for Public Administrations and citizens


The Data & Analytics Framework (DAF) has the goal of improving and simplifying the interoperability and exchange of data between Pubblic Administrations, promoting and improving the management and usage of Open Data, optimizing activities of analysis and knowledge generation. The idea is to open the world of Public Administration to the benefits offered by modern Big Data management and analysis platforms. Thanks to Big Data technologies, it will be possible to operate along three main lines:

* Significantly enhance the value of PA’s information assets through the preparation and use of analytical tools designed to synthesise knowledge for decision makers, and the dissemination of information to citizens and businesses.

* Optimize data exchange between PAs and Open Data deployment, minimizing transaction costs for data access and usage.

* Facilitate data analysis and data management by data scientist teams within the PA, in order to improve knowledge of the phenomena described by the data and develop “intelligent” applications, as well as take initiatives to promote scientific research activities on application themes of interest to the PA.
