### In short

SPID, the Public Digital Identity System, is the solution that allows for access to all the Public Administration services online, with a single Digital Identity that can be used on computers, tablets and smartphones. Today, our digital credentials are different for each service that we access. A drastic reduction in their number would lead to the simplification of the citizen&#39;s life and to greater security.

### Benefits for citizens and the public administration

SPID allows the Public Administration to abandon locally-managed authentication services, thus saving on such costs both in terms of maintenance and work necessary for issuing credentials. Moreover, the quality of the identification provided by the SPID is normally higher and also provides guarantees to the PA itself during the provision of services.

Citizens have the opportunity to maintain only one set of credentials, which can be used with all of the Public Administration services and which, amongst other things, ensures greater security, especially when using SPID Levels 2 and 3. Furthermore, unlike other popular log-in systems, SPID guarantees that every connected service always receives only the minimum information necessary for the provision of the service, without sharing information on usage with others, thus guaranteeing the privacy of citizens. Finally, an SPID identity can be used to access all of the Public Administration services for all countries that are members of the European Union.
