### In short

CIE, the Italian Electronic Identity Card, is a highly secure electronic document, equipped with a radio frequency microprocessor that enables it for various use cases, including access to online services. CIE complies with security regulations and substitutes the previous paper format.

### The benefits for citizens and the public administration

CIE is a document not subject to counterfeiting and allows secure access to physical and digital services.

Public Administration can rely on a more secure identification document, also complying with European requirements,
allowing the completion of one of the enabling platforms listed in the Three-Year Plan. 

Furthermore, it allows the creation of physical and digital public services that integrate the CIE as an identification tool
(eg. for use of public transport) and contributes to achieving the European single digital market goal.
